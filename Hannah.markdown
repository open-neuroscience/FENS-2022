<strong> Open technologies for Super-Resolution in BioImaging </strong>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Super-resolution microscopy has become essential for the study of nanoscale biological processes. This type of imaging often requires specialised methods to collect and process a large volume of recorded data and extract quantitative information.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In recent years, the Henriques Lab and collaborators have built an open-source ecosystem of computational, biochemical and optical approaches for live-cell super-resolution microscopy, designed to combine high performance and ease of use.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This talk will present some of these approaches such as SRRF, SQUIRREL and VirusMapper, and especially highlight our most recent contribution: eSRRF (enhanced-SRRF), which gains a significant improvement by refining the reconstruction principles of super-resolution radial fluctuation (SRRF) microscopy while providing a first-of-its-kind automated parameter optimisation tool.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Furthermore, we extended the eSRRF reconstruction algorithm to perform 3D super-resolution microscopy when combined with multifocus microscopy. With this approach, we realised live-cell friendly volumetric super- resolution imaging of live cells with acquisition speed on the order of 1 volume / second.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Coming from a background of semiconductor physics and nanofabrication switched over to the Biophysics and fluorescence microscopy field for my Master studies and my PhD. I love working in an interdisciplinary team to study cell biology by combining biophotonics and high-end microscopy. In the Henriques Lab I will establish automated and intelligent super-resolution microscopy to study host pathogen interactions.
