<strong>LEGOlish Workshop </strong>  

Friday 8th of July - 16:55  
<strong> LEGOlish, a creative project to promote Lightsheet Microscopy in a simple and visual form to a larger public and for education purposes </strong>


<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Similar to a lightsheet microscope, LEGOlish includes a laser source (450nm), a sample holder that can rotate and translate, several filters to select the fluorescence range, and a detection system to create images.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
However, the goal was to make it as simple and economic as possible, so that anyone could build its own LEGOlish at home or in the lab.

The laser is a 5 or 10mW diode (450nm), the translation/rotation stage are mode of LEGO bricks and gears with manual wheels, the filters are simply old school color filters from 3D glasses (paper version !) and the detection system is your mobile phone !
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The laser forms a plane of light that can illuminate any centimeter-sized samples. Here a biological sample (autofluorescence in green) inside a bottle (laser light in blue).

When the sample is translated, more images are acquired and a 3D volume can be reconstructed

Coming from a background of semiconductor physics and nanofabrication switched over to the Biophysics and fluorescence microscopy field for my Master studies and my PhD. I love working in an interdisciplinary team to study cell biology by combining biophotonics and high-end microscopy. In the Henriques Lab I will establish automated and intelligent super-resolution microscopy to study host pathogen interactions.
