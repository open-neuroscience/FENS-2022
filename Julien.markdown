<strong>LEGOlish Workshop </strong>  

Friday 8th of July - 16:55  
<strong> LEGOlish, a creative project to promote Lightsheet Microscopy in a simple and visual form to a larger public and for education purposes. LEMOLish: its upgraded version with scientific performance, meant to help life science labs to deploy lightsheet imaging at a cost inferior to the samples preparation ! </strong>


<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Similar to a lightsheet microscope, LEGOlish includes a laser source, a sample holder that can rotate and translate, several filters to select the fluorescence range, and a detection system to create images.

Similar to a lightsheet microscope, LEGOlish includes a laser source, a sample holder that can rotate and translate, several filters to select the fluorescence range, and a detection system to create images.

However, the goal was to make it as simple and economic as possible, so that anyone could build its own LEGOlish at home or in the lab. The laser is a 5 or 10mW diode (450nm), the translation/rotation stage are mode of LEGO bricks and gears with manual wheels, the filters are simply old school color filters from 3D glasses (paper version !) and the detection system is your mobile phone ! The laser forms a plane of light that can illuminate any centimeter-sized samples. When the sample is translated, more images are acquired and a 3D volume can be reconstructed.

LEMOLish is the motorized LEGO®-based light sheet microscope built to acquire scientific 3D images from centimeter-sized optically cleared biological samples. The system is open source, versatile, and costs about a hundred times less than existing custom/commercial solutions! LEMOLish comes with innovative optical solutions to keep performance of scientific imaging  high, and the instrument cost as low as possible, and keeps the LEGO philosophy to enable future LEMOlishers to adapt, modify and upgrade it easily.
