Recently, we presented a non-telecentric (nTC) ultra-low-cost solution for 3D random access mesoscale imaging in two-photon microscopy [1]. Using a standard x20 objective, this nTC- approach allowed increasing the field of view from typically 0.5 mm to 3.5 mm, with a corresponding elongation of the point spread function (PSF). With the addition of an electrically tunable lens, we further achieved a z-range of 600 μm within 2 ms, all without strongly distorting the excitation volume or efficiency. While this approach has already been useful in a range of experimental works [1-5], the issue remained that the PSF would grow with the expansion of the field of view, thus limiting spatial resolution.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Here, we present a next step in the optimisation of nTC: expansion of the field of view without affecting PSF size. Still using the same x20 objective, we maintain a diffraction limited resolution up to a field of view of ~0.8 mm. This for example allows us to image the entire length of a larval zebrafish brain while comfortably maintaining single cell resolution.
