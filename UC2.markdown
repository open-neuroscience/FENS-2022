<strong>UC2 â€“ A Versatile and Customizable low-cost 3D-printed Optical Open-Standard for microscopic imaging</strong>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
With UC2 (You-See-Too) we present an inexpensive 3D-printed microscopy toolbox. The system is based on concepts of modular development, rapid-prototyping and all-time accessibility using widely available off-the-shelf optic and electronic components. We aim to democratize microscopy, reduce the reproduction crisis and enhance trust into science by making it available to everyone via an open-access public repository.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
 Due to its versatility the aim is to boost creativity and non-conventional approaches. In this paper, we demonstrate a development cycle from basic blocks to different microscopic techniques. First, we build a bright-field system and stress-test it by observing macrophage cell differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation incubator-enclosed for seven days with automatic focussing to minimize axial drift. We prove versatility by assembling a system using the same components to a fully working fluorescence light-sheet system and acquire a 3D volume of a GFP-expressing living drosophila larvae.

Finally, we sketch and demonstrate further possible setups to draw a picture on how the system can be used for reproducible prototyping in scientific research. All design files for replicating the experimental setups are provided via an open-access online repository (https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-GIT) to foster widespread use.
